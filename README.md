## Introduction
Welcome to the 100 Days of C Programming Challenge! This challenge aims to enhance your C programming skills over 100 days.

Each day, you'll dive into a new C programming concept, solve coding problems, or work on practical projects. Topics include memory management, file handling, data structures, algorithms, networking, and more.

This challenge suits C beginners and intermediate learners who want to strengthen their programming abilities and build real-world applications. It's also an opportunity to connect with fellow learners, share knowledge, and collaborate.

We're excited to see your progress and the projects you create with C!

## How to Participate
1. Fork this repository and create a new branch to track your progress.
2. Dedicate at least one hour daily to coding and learning C for the next 100 days.
3. Share your daily progress on Twitter  using the hashtag #100DaysOfCChallenge and tag us @omawchar07.
4. Engage in discussions and share your experiences in the Discussions section of this repository.

## Rules
- Code for at least one hour daily (including weekends and holidays).
- Focus on areas of C programming you want to learn or improve.
- Share your daily progress on social media.
- Avoid copying code from the internet; strive for clean and elegant solutions.
- When possible, write tests for your code.
